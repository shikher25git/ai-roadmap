This repo contains the code snippets that I'm playing around with to developing an understanding of ML, DL and AI models and how these work.

The code snippets are being drafted by me and I'm using Cursor to improve them and learn about the possible improvements.

Cursor also helps in documenting what was the improvement and charting a graph.
